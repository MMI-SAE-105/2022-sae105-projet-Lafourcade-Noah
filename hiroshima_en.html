        <h1>HIROSHIMA</h1>
        <h2>A city but not only!</h2>

        <p class="text">Hiroshima is a city well known to everyone. Even if we don't know the city or what
            it includes, we all necessarily know its tragic history of the Second World War.
            Hiroshima means "wide island" it is located on the island of Honshu, the largest
            island in Japanese territory. But you should know that Hiroshima is not just a
            tragic story, it is also a tourist place greatly appreciated by tourists who come
            there for its landscape, it's rather original monuments and of course its history
            which has managed to stand the test of time!
            </P>

        <h2>A few places to visit…</h2>

        <p class="text">Hiroshima has many buildings of Japanese culture such as its castle, the
            "Hiroshima Castle"
            , unfortunately this castle originally built of pine was destroyed
            by the Second World War in 1945, it has was then rebuilt in 1958 in reinforced
            concrete to better last over time (only the main base was rebuilt), and now serves
            as a museum telling its whole story.</p>

        <p class="text_image"> Photo of Hiroshima Castle's </p>

        <p class="text">Miyajima Castle, we don't know the name but we've probably seen it before! His
            famous photo with a Shinto torii placed on a pillar to give the illusion that it floats
            on water, the place is described as one of the 3 most beautiful places visited in
            Japan, because of its landscape, but also its history! Considered a sacred island
            (the island of Itsukushima) it is located on Hiroshima Bay, there would have
            previously been deities living there. </p>

        <p class="text">Hiroshima remains very different from other Japanese metropolises due to the
            fact that it is first of all isolated but also by its original tourist sites compared to
            other cities, whether by its architecture, its culture, or even its vegetation which
            manages to evolve, see improving over time.
