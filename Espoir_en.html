        <h1>A REBUILD FUTURE</h1>

        <h2>Young people, the solution for a better world</h2>

        <p class="text"> Although they consider themselves very informed about environmental issues
            (self-assessment 7/10), young people still admit that they are unaware of the
            issue and the impact of human activity on the planet and do not seek to find out
            more.They are also aware of a low level of daily engagement (4/10 during the
            self-assessment of their specific actions). </p>

        <p class="text"> For them, environmental "efforts" are
            mainly focused on consumption. Thus, they cite purchasing power as the first
            lever for environmental action. Still dependent on their parents, they don't feel
            guilty for not taking action because they don't have the financial capacity to do
            so.</p>

        <p class="text_image"> Group of young people on their phones</p>

        <p class="text"> As said before, even if some do “nothing” to change the current state of the
            planet, there are still some who do everything they can to keep doing a little
            thing. Young people are aware that today’s world is in danger and that they have
            a role to play in transforming the environment. Far from being passive victims,
            they are more responsible on the subject. The proof is in the action of the
            Swedish Greta Thunberg. An environmental activist, in 2018 she spearheaded the
            global youth movement: Friday’s for future. </p>

        <p class="text"> Therefore, this generation of social
            and instant networks requires fast and specific responses. She is ready to change
            their daily lives and adopt eco-friendly actions to save the Earth. His intentions of
            our generation are therefore encouraging and positive for the future. It remains to
            be hoped that this will continue!</p>
